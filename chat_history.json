This will lead you to the Oracle Internet Directory Login page.\n5. Enter the distinguished name (DN) of a directory user who can administer enterprise users in the User field. Input the user password in the Password field and click Login.\n6. Once logged in, click on Configure Databases. This action will display a list of databases registered in the identity management realm.\n7. Select the specific database you want to work on, then click on Configure.\n8. On the Configure Database page, click on the User-Schema Mappings tab. Here, you will see all the user-schema maps created at the database level.\n9. To create a new user-schema mapping, click on Create. This will take you to the Create Mapping page.\n10.
